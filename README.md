# Cryptographic-System
The process of transforming regular plain text into unintelligible text and vice versa is known as cryptography. It is a technique for keeping and sending data in a specific format that only the intended audience can read and process.

Encryption-Algorithm - A ciphertext is generated by an encryption algorithm using a given plaintext and encryption key. It is a cryptographic technique that generates ciphertext from plaintext and an encryption key as input.

Decryption-Algorithm - A decryption algorithm is a mathematical technique that generates a unique plaintext from ciphertext and decryption key. It is a cryptographic algorithm that takes a ciphertext and a decryption key as input and produces plaintext as output. The decryption algorithm is closely related to the encryption algorithm since it reverses it.

This programme accepts user input in the form of a message and prompts the user to choose whether the message should be decoded or encoded before printing the outcome on the screen.
